NestJS:
    Backend JS framework inspired by Angular
    Generate a new project with: "nest new quotes-server"
    Execute "npm run start:dev" and navigate to: "http://localhost:3000/"
    
Dry Run Command:
    Displays files to be generated without actually generating them:
        (ie. 'nest g controller quotes --dry-run' or 
             'nest g controller quotes --no-spec --dry-run')
    Dry Run Generation - Allows for seeing the files affected by executing 
        certain nest commands. Just add the switch "--dry-run"
    
Postman:
    Use Postman to process POST statements/params/responses etc.

Posts:
    Receive/process GET and POST messages
    Send output through functions of the server 

Interfaces:
    DTO -  Encapsulates data (think transport), and sends it from one subsystem 
        of an application to another.
    Interface - Used for type-checking and defining (think definition) the types 
        of data that can be passed to a controller or a Nest service.
    
Swagger:
    Install with: "npm i @nestjs/swagger swagger-ui-express"
    Define options in main.ts
    Result should be an auto-generated Swagger doc that can be found at:
        http://localhost:3000/api/
    Testing of the API can now be done with "try it out" and "execute" functions, 
        thereby eliminating the need for Postman
    
Debug:
    Click on Debug icon in far left VSCode margin
    Edit launch.json by replacing section of config (use intellisense to assist) with:
        {
            "type":         "node",
            "request":      "attach",
            "name":         "Attach by Process ID",
            "processId":    "${command:PickProcess}"
        }
    Select "Attach by Process ID" | or | 'Javascript Debug Terminal' on play button
    Click Play button | or | enter "npm run start:dev" in terminal
    Select "node dist/main.js"| or | run Swagger test to begin
    When stopped at breakpoint, observe values displayed at left column

CORS:
    CORS can be enabled by adding "app.enableCors();" to main.ts 
        (ie. "https://docs.nestjs.com/security/cors")    
    
Mongo:
    Install with: "npm install --save @nestjs/mongoose mongoose"
    Add "import { MongooseModule } from '@nestjs/mongoose';" to module.ts 
    Add "imports: [MongooseModule.forRoot('mongodb://localhost/nest')]," to 
        imports section of module.ts
